# Distributed System with Flask, Django, and RabbitMQ

## ðŸ“Œ Description
  This project is a distributed system based on microservices that interact asynchronously using RabbitMQ. It consists of two main services:

- **Client (Flask)**: Allows users to like and rate products.
- **Admin (Django)**: Manages products and processes rating and like messages.

The system is scalable and utilizes Docker, NGINX, and Consul for load balancing and service discovery.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Python (Flask & Django)**
- **RabbitMQ** (messaging broker)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **NGINX** (reverse proxy and load balancing)
- **Consul** (service discovery)
- **MySQL & SQLite** (databases)
- **Postman** (API testing)
